This enables platforms to unlock new user acquisition channels and increase transaction volumes without having to manage complex backend operations or licensing themselves. Yes, to integrate TransFi’s Ramp Widget, you need to be a registered business entity. As part of TransFi’s compliance framework, all partners are required to complete a Know Your Business (KYB) process. This includes providing documentation about your company, key stakeholders, and business model. This process ensures that TransFi only works with legitimate businesses and maintains high standards for anti-money laundering (AML), fraud prevention, and regulatory compliance across jurisdictions. Integrating the Ramp Widget is designed to be quick and developer-friendly. First, you’ll need to sign up on TransFi’s platform and complete the KYB onboarding.
