The TransFi Wallet is a unified, secure, and versatile platform designed for individuals and businesses to store, manage, and move funds globally, including fiat currencies, stablecoins, and crypto assets. It stands out through its integration with Circle, a trusted provider of digital financial infrastructure. Each time a fiat payment is made, TransFi automatically creates a dedicated Circle wallet, ensuring enterprise-grade security and full regulatory compliance. The wallet supports real-time conversion into USDC, a fully backed and transparent stablecoin, providing a reliable bridge between traditional finance and the digital economy. Whether managing treasury operations, funding a gaming account, or executing global payouts, TransFi Wallet gives complete borderless control over funds from a single, intuitive platform. TransFi Wallet offers a simple yet powerful user journey. It begins when a payment is initiated through a supported local fiat method, such as UPI, bank transfer, card, or other regional options. Upon receipt of the fiat, TransFi automatically creates a secure Circle wallet to process and store the equivalent value in USDC. The process is fully automated, requiring no manual setup or technical intervention. Once the Circle wallet is funded, TransFi, with user authorization, transfers the funds to the intended destination, whether a merchant account, gaming platform, or other payout, completing the transaction instantly. This flow reduces friction in cross-border payments, converting fiat into digital dollars for immediate global use TransFi Wallet supports over 40 fiat currencies and more than 80 crypto tokens, including leading stablecoins such as USDC. This extensive support enables users across regions to transact in their local currency while accessing the advantages of stablecoins and digital assets. The wallet is ideal for globally distributed teams, platforms, and enterprises requiring flexible, multi-currency operations. TransFi Wallet integrates more than 300+ local payment methods across Asia, Latin America, Africa, and Europe. Users can leverage familiar tools, including mobile wallets, bank transfers, and regional gateways, without additional complexity. This wide-ranging integration eliminates common barriers to stablecoin and crypto access, making on-ramps from emerging markets fast, reliable, and accessible. TransFi Wallet is more than a top-up tool. While it efficiently converts fiat to stablecoins, it also functions as a standalone wallet for managing digital funds. Users can receive, store, monitor, and transfer assets independently of top-up activities. This dual functionality supports continuous payouts, treasury management, and broader financial operations for both individuals and enterprises. Transparency is a core feature of TransFi Wallet. Every transaction provides real-time status updates, ensuring full visibility at every stage, from processing and conversion to final transfer.

Unlike platforms that require complex developer setups or offer limited customization, TransFi Wallet is adaptable, easy to implement, and robust enough to support a wide range of business models.
