Some payment methods may require onboarding by the payment service providers, and you agree to share information and provide additional details as needed. 5.7 Card Payment Methods When using card payment methods, you must comply with the rules specified by the respective card schemes. TransFi may modify the Services to comply with scheme rules, which may change without prior notice. Card schemes may request information associated with your Account. 5.8 Holds and Reserves Holds: TransFi may temporarily hold the processing of transactions under certain circumstances, such as ongoing Chargebacks, increased risks, complaints, or investigations.

Reserves: TransFi may impose a rolling reserve requirement on your Account based on factors such as industry, risk, losses, or activity. You will be notified of the reserve amount, timing, and release conditions. TransFi may change the terms of the reserve based on ongoing assessment and monitoring. Upon termination of the Account and Services, you will be entitled to receive the Reserve Amount, or the balance after any Chargeback deductions, 180 days from the agreed delivery date. 5.9 Chargebacks The reasons for Chargebacks include (but are not limited to): (a) the transaction amount not being authorized; (b) the End User or cardholder alleging: ● non-participation in the transaction; or ● non-authorization of the use of the card; or ● non-receipt of goods and/or services purchased; (c) canceled or uncompleted pre-authorized transaction, or (d) suspected fraud on the card.

Customers must monitor their Merchants' activities and ensure they have appropriate measures to manage these issues effectively.

TransFi may suspend the Account if excessive Chargebacks occur. You are responsible for all costs associated with Chargeback representations. 5.10 Refunds You can instruct TransFi to perform partial or full refunds through the dashboard. Refunds may not be supported for all payment methods, but TransFi will try to help them on a best-efforts basis.

Unless otherwise approved, Refunds encompass the original payment amount minus applicable service fees. TransFi will debit refunds from your received funds, and you must cover any shortfalls. TransFi may charge additional fees and adjust foreign exchange rates to process refunds. You may only issue refunds for services you have provided and cannot use a payment method different from the original transaction. TransFi may refuse refunds that do not meet these Terms or any other terms and conditions referenced herein or are prohibited by Applicable Law. You will be notified of any refund refusal and the reasons for it. TransFi is not liable for non-execution or defective execution of refunds due to incorrect details you provided but will make reasonable efforts to recover funds. 6.

Such issues could result in you losing your assets or experiencing delays in your ability to sell, transfer, or use them. The value of Digital Assets and fiat can change rapidly, decrease significantly, and potentially even fall to zero. Factors that may influence these fluctuations include changes in regulatory governance, the introduction of new Digital Assets or changes to existing ones, or alterations in the economic stability associated with fiat currencies.

You understand and agree that TransFi accepts no liability for you providing an incorrect or inaccurate Wallet address as part of an order. By providing a Wallet address to us, you confirm that this is the Wallet address that should be used for the relevant order, and we will not, and have no responsibility to, check whether you have provided a correct and accurate Wallet address for the order. You acknowledge and agree, without prejudice to any other terms in this Agreement, that you bear all of the risk of any loss of access to your Wallet and any Digital Assets contained in your Wallet.

Such issues could result in you losing your assets or experiencing delays in your ability to sell, transfer, or use them. The value of Digital Assets and fiat can change rapidly, decrease significantly, and potentially even fall to zero. Factors that may influence these fluctuations include changes in regulatory governance, the introduction of new Digital Assets or changes to existing ones, or alterations in the economic stability associated with fiat currencies.

By providing a Wallet address to us, you confirm that this is the Wallet address that should be used for the relevant order and we will not, and have no responsibility to, check whether you have provided a correct and accurate Wallet address for the order. You acknowledge and agree, without prejudice to any other terms in this Agreement, that you bear all of the risk of any loss of access to your Wallet(s) and any Digital Assets contained in your Wallet(s). TransFi does not control and is not responsible for the Digital Assets in your Wallet(s). You are solely responsible for any Digital Assets transferred to or from your Wallet(s) and we make no, and hereby disclaim all, representations, warranties, claims and assurances as to any such transactions.

TransFi may act through any of its subsidiaries in the provision of the Services. TransFi Wallet: A custodial digital wallet offered by TransFi for the purpose of storing and managing Digital Assets. TransFi’s third-party service provider manages and holds the wallet’s End User’s private keys. ‍ DISCLAIMER: The risk of loss in trading or holding Digital Assets can be substantial. You should be aware that the price or value of Digital Assets, including, but not limited to, cryptocurrencies, digital tokens, and NFTs, can change rapidly, decrease, and potentially even fall to zero. Therefore, you should carefully consider whether trading or holding Digital Assets suits you in light of your financial circumstances. You acknowledge that if you use your own custodial digital wallet not offered by TransFi to access the Services, TransFi is not responsible for and does not hold the private keys for your Digital Assets wallet or any other security information to access your Digital Assets and that TransFi is not responsible for any loss of Digital Assets resulting from theft, loss, or mishandling of private keys or other security information outside its control. If you use a TransFi Wallet, your use of that TransFi Wallet will also be subject to the Wallet & Earn Feature Terms & Conditions. Every purchase and sale of Digital Assets is executed on and confirmed by the respective network of that Digital Asset. The confirmation process takes time (typically less than one hour, but potentially one day or more). An order is not complete until it is confirmed. Digital Assets associated with orders that are pending will be designated accordingly. A transaction between a buyer and a seller occurs peer-to-peer on a public blockchain. We do not guarantee that you will receive your Digital Asset, as there are several reasons why transactions may fail. For example, network congestion, a technical blockchain issue, or another buyer completing a purchase of that Digital Asset before your transaction completes on the blockchain. If your transaction fails, TransFi will use reasonable efforts to facilitate a refund of any applicable fees. ‍ 2.

TRANSFI FACILITATES THE CREATION AND MANAGEMENT OF TRANSFI WALLET FOR USERS AND END USERS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, WHO ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR KEY MANAGEMENT, WALLET SECURITY, AND COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE REGULATIONS RELATED TO WALLETS. TRANSFI IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES ARISING FROM WALLET SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING KEY MANAGEMENT FAILURES, AS THEY ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MANAGEMENT AND SECURITY OF THE TRANSFI WALLET. TRANSFI DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR ANY LOSS, BREACH, OR FAILURE ARISING FROM THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER’S MANAGEMENT OF TRANSFI WALLET. THE CUSTOMER INDEMNIFIES AND HOLDS TRANSFI HARMLESS AGAINST ANY CLAIMS, LOSSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING FROM THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER’S FAILURE TO PERFORM ITS WALLET RESPONSIBILITIES. 18.4 RISK DISCLOSURES, ASSUMPTION OF RISKS, AND RELEASE OF TRANSFI. OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, TRANSFI SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY RISKS INHERENT IN THE SERVICES OR RELATED TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING WALLET TRANSACTIONS, THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY THE END USER OR THE CUSTOMER AND THEIR MERCHANTS AS A RESULT THEREOF. THE END USER, CUSTOMER, AND THEIR MERCHANT AGREE TO AND DO HEREBY: (I) RELEASE TRANSFI FROM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RELATED TO OR ARISING FROM RISKS INHERENT IN THE SERVICES AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING WALLET TRANSACTIONS, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT; AND (II) ASSUME ALL RISKS INHERENT IN THE SERVICES AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING: THE RISK THAT ANY THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS OF TRANSFI CEASE TO OPERATE, RENDERING A TRANSACTION IMPOSSIBLE AND ENTIRELY WITHOUT USE. THE MARKET FOR DIGITAL ASSETS MAY COLLAPSE WITHOUT WARNING OR DISCERNIBLE LOGIC. THERE IS A RISK THAT CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAW COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE CUSTOMER’S RIGHT TO LEGALLY USE, TRANSFER, EXCHANGE, AND/OR OBTAIN VALUE FROM DIGITAL ASSETS. IT MAY BE ILLEGAL, NOW OR IN THE FUTURE, TO OWN, HOLD, SELL, OR USE DIGITAL ASSETS IN ONE OR MORE COUNTRIES. TRANSACTIONS IN DIGITAL ASSETS ARE, AS A RULE, IRREVERSIBLE. CONSEQUENTLY, LOSSES DUE TO FRAUDULENT OR ACCIDENTAL TRANSACTIONS ARE GENERALLY NOT RECOVERABLE. ONCE A TRANSACTION HAS BEEN RECORDED ON THE APPROVED NETWORK, IT IS NOT REVERSIBLE.

SOME TRANSACTIONS SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE WHEN RECORDED ON THE APPROVED NETWORK, WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY THE DATE OR TIME THAT THE CUSTOMER INITIATED THE TRANSACTION. DIGITAL ASSETS MAY BE TARGETS OF FRAUD AND CYBER-ATTACKS. ON DEVICES AND WALLETS, SUCH FRAUD AND ATTACKS CAN RESULT IN TOTAL LOSS TO THE CUSTOMER. IN THE WALLET, TRANSFI MAKES COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO VERIFY THAT THE CUSTOMER IS THE TRUE INITIATOR OF TRANSACTIONS, BUT WHERE THE CUSTOMER’S ACCOUNT IS COMPROMISED, SUCH EFFORTS MAY FAIL AND COULD RESULT IN TOTAL LOSS OF DIGITAL ASSETS IN THE WALLET. ATTACKS ON TRANSFI MAY ALSO RESULT IN UNPLANNED AND SIGNIFICANT UNSCHEDULED DOWNTIME DURING WHICH TRANSACTIONS WILL NOT BE EXECUTED. ABSENT FRAUD OR INTENTIONAL WRONGDOING ON THE PART OF TRANSFI, TRANSFI SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR CUSTOMER LOSSES ON ACCOUNT OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING CIRCUMSTANCES OR COMPROMISED ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS. AS A GOOD FAITH HOLDER OF DIGITAL ASSETS IN THE WALLET, THERE IS A RISK THAT THE CUSTOMER WILL LOSE POSSESSION THEREOF IF TRANSFI DETERMINES THAT IT WAS PREVIOUSLY TRANSFERRED BY FRAUDULENT MEANS OR TRANSFERRED OTHERWISE IN VIOLATION OF THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF THE CUSTOMER HAD NO PART IN THE WRONGDOING. THE SERVICES AND DIGITAL ASSETS RELY ON THE INTERNET, WHICH INCLUDES THIRD-PARTY HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND INTERNET CONNECTIONS, ALL OF WHICH MAY SUFFER COMMUNICATION FAILURES, DISRUPTIONS, ERRORS, DISTORTIONS, OR DELAYS THAT MIGHT AFFECT THE CUSTOMER’S ABILITY TO ACCESS AND USE SERVICES SUCH AS THE ACCOUNT AND WALLET.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION Please read the following Arbitration Agreement carefully because it requires you to arbitrate all disputes with us and limits the manner in which you can seek relief. 17.1 You and the Company agree to resolve any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of the Terms & Conditions or to the Services through confidential, final and binding arbitration. 17.2 The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision. Arbitration shall be initiated through JAMS. Any arbitration shall be conducted (a) confidentially, (b) in English, (c) by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”), (d) before a single arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes, and (e) in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. 17.3 TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, INSTEAD ELECTING THAT ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES SHALL BE RESOLVED BY ARBITRATION. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, you and the Company, to the fullest extent permitted by law, waive all rights to a jury trial instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THE TERMS TO ARBITRATE. 17.4 This Agreement will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, USA and, subject to any overriding legal requirements, the parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of the State of Delaware, USA. This Agreement and any information or notifications that you or we are to provide should be in English. 17.5 You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed. TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES MUST BE BROUGHT IN A PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. A CLAIMANT OR THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS OR ENGAGE IN ANY CLASS ARBITRATION OR JOINT LITIGATION. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY, ON A CLASS BASIS OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND WE ARE WAIVING ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS REPRESENTATIVE IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. 18.
