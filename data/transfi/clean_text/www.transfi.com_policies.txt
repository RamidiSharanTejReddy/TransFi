Your files are protected with safeguards according to the sensitivity of the relevant information. Reasonable controls (such as restricted access) are placed on our computer systems.

While we take industry-standard precautions to safeguard your personal information and secure your account, no system can be completely secure. As such, you assume the risk of potential breaches and their consequences. To protect your account, please safeguard your credentials, choose a complex password when registering, enable advanced security features like two-factor authentication, and never share your account credentials with third parties.

We do not knowingly request to collect personal information from any person under the age of 18. If a User submitting personal information is suspected of being younger than 18 years of age, TransFi will require the User to close his or her account and will not allow the User to continue using our Services. We will also take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. We retain personal information as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil its intended purposes and meet our contractual and legal obligations. Email addresses and phone numbers are stored until the User uses the TransFi Services, and data is retained for five years once the User unsubscribes or removes themselves. Information will be deleted or de-identified when no longer needed, unless longer retention is required by law. TransFi retains certain information under AML/CTF regulations and holds data for a period of five years. If we cannot fully delete or de-identify information, we will take reasonable measures to prevent further processing. 7. Do we do any profiling and automated decision making? We may use some instances of your data in order to customise our Services and the information we provide to you, and to address your needs - such as your country of address and transaction history. For example, if you frequently send funds from one particular currency to another, we may use this information to inform you of new product updates or features that may be useful for you. When we do this, we take all necessary measures to ensure that your privacy and security are protected - and we only use pseudonymised data wherever possible. This activity has no legal effect on you. 8. What are your privacy and information access rights?

Please note that there may be circumstances where you ask us to erase your personal information, but we are legally entitled to retain it; the right to object to, or request that we restrict, our processing of your personal information in certain circumstances. Again, there may be circumstances where you object to, or ask us to restrict, our processing of your personal information but we are legally entitled to refuse that request; the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant data protection regulator if you think that any of your rights have been infringed by us; and the right to transfer your personal data between data controllers, for example, to move your account details from one online platform to another.

The alert assessment time should be reasonable, and the MLRO or other authorized compliance employee should take appropriate and timely measures to ascertain whether the transaction/operation is suspicious or not. If the Customer is requested to provide additional information needed for the assessment, the overall alert assessment term may be extended, however, in such a case the Customer needs to be informed that the Customer’s transaction/operation will not be executed until the Customer provides sufficient information. The term shall not be extended for more than 4 days in total (except for very specific situations when there is a reasonable ground to extend the term more). If the Customer fails to provide requested information and/or if the assessment shows that the transaction or operation is suspicious, the MLRO of the Company shall submit a Suspicious Operation Report to FCIS as specified under Section 13 of this Policy. ‍ Retrospective monitoring – there are two types of retrospective monitoring to be applied by the Company: ‍ Following criteria and scenarios set by the Company, the system „catches” activities that are not standard for the particular Customer, but which are executed and not blocked on a real-time basis. Such „caught” transactions or operations shall be assessed by MLRO or other authorized compliance employee no later than within 30 calendar days period from the moment the relevant transaction or operation was flagged in the retrospective monitoring system. If the assessment shows that the transaction or operation is suspicious, the MLRO of the Company shall submit a Report to FCIS; On a regular basis but not less frequently than once per half a year the MLRO may decide to check historical transactions of a relevant type of Customer which would serve as a secondary measure in addition to the main retrospective monitoring procedure described in item (a) above. The aim of such additional checks is to ascertain that all potentially suspicious or non-standard transactions were found and assessed by the Company. MLRO shall be responsible and shall decide what type of Customers should be checked (e.g. 10 biggest Customers according to the amount of their payments; Customers whose payments are related to high-risk geographical regions, etc.). The Company shall monitor transactions to ensure that they are in line with the Customer’s risk, and examine the source of funds when required (Annex No. 7 to this Policy) to detect possible ML / TF. The Company shall also keep the documents, data, or information it holds up to date, with a view to understanding whether the risk associated with the Business Relationship has changed. The Company collects source of funds documents under the following circumstances: All types of Customers: when they are high risk are subjected to EDD; All types of Customers: when they reach daily / monthly transaction thresholds; All types of Customers: when the Client’s transaction behavior shows major changes (e.g. order size is significantly bigger than the average order size of previous transactions); Only legal entity Customers: All businesses that fall under our requirements of EDD are required to submit these documents. EDD kicks in when the business falls under the following criteria: All types of Customers: when they are high risk are subjected to EDD; All types of Customers: when they reach daily / monthly transaction thresholds; All types of Customers: when the Client’s transaction behavior shows major changes (e.g. order size is significantly bigger than the average order size of previous transactions); Only legal entity Customers: All businesses that fall under our requirements of EDD are required to submit these documents.

In such a case the Company shall ensure that third parties would follow requirements specified in this Policy and the Law and would align their IT systems and platforms so that all monitoring criteria and scenarios set by the Company would be properly covered. The Company will use a risk-based matrix that will define various risk levels, namely, high, medium, and low. All the risk categories will be subjected to transaction thresholds which are based on various qualifiers in the case of an individual or a legal entity: Individual: the Company will categorise the Client in various risk categories and impose transaction thresholds based on the selection of payment methods and jurisdictions along with user behaviour. Legal entity: The Company will categorise the Client into various risk categories and impose transaction thresholds based on various risk factors like the pedigree of the company, Internet risk profiling score, onboarding tenure, and geographical risks.
